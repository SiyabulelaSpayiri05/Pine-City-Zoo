        <h3>LIONS</h3>
        <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a 
        large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa 
        and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, 
        rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of 
        its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are 
        larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social 
        species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists 
        of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually 
        hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. 
            The lion is an apex and keystone predator.

    The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is 
    usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it
     adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic 
     period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to
      India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa
     and one population in western India.
