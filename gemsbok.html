        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
        <p>
            The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is 
            a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and bar
            ren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbab
            we, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which
             it is supremely adapted for survival. Previously, some sources classified the re
            lated East African oryx, or beisa oryx (Oryx beisa), as a subspecies
        </p>
        <p>
            Gemsbok are light taupe
             to tan in color, with lighter patches
              toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long 
              and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the
               lower edge of the
               neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg 
               along the lower flank of each
                side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They
                 have muscular necks and shoulders, and their 
                legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and
                 both sexes have long, straight horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the bas
                 e of the tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. 
                 One very rare color morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.
