        <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
        <p>
        Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly 
        known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog). They are pigs who 
        live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions,
         in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific 
         under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited
          to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, 
        the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus.[2]
