        <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
        <p>
            Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
             infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, 
             all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
              except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute a
            n incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included.

<p>
    Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are 
    species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species a
    re mainly active during the day (diurnal)
    . Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.
