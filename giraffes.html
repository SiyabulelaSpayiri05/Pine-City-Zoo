        <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
        <p>
The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal
 belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the 
 tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.
  Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa 
  camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers 
  proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new research 
  into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species can
   be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Six valid extinct species 
of Giraffa from Africa and Pakistan are known from the fossil record.

    The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely 
    long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted coat patterns. 
    It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest 
    extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in 
    the north to South Africa in the south and from Niger in the west to
     Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits,
      and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at
     heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot reach.
